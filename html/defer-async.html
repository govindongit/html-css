<!-- 
Difference between defer and async in script loading?

Explanation:

async: script loads independently and executes as soon as it's ready. ---- Use async for third-party or standalone scripts (e.g., Google Analytics).

defer: script loads in parallel but executes after HTML is parsed. ---- Use defer for scripts that need to manipulate or interact with the DOM.
